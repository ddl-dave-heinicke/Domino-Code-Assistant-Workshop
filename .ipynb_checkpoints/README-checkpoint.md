* Set up Domino Code Assist in your Project & Workspace
* Explore Data Ingest with Code Assist
* Work through pre-built Transforms to your data
* Create plots using pre-built visualizations
* Load and create code snippets for future re-use
* Build an app using Domino Code Assistant 

## Section 1 - Setting Up Domimno Code Assistant

Domino Code Assistant is simply a Python packae or R package running in a Domino Workspace. 

There are four distinct approaches to installing Domino Code Assist (DCA) for either Python or R:

* Install in a Workspace
* Install in a Project
* Install in a Compute Environment or
* Install from Source.

The first approach is the easiest way to get started with DCA. But if you restart you workspace, then you will need to reinstall DCA. The second and third approaches will enable DCA more permanently.
